      "full": "Garuda is a divine bird creature central to Hindu and Buddhist mythology. As the mount (vahana) of the god Vishnu, Garuda is depicted with a golden eagle or hawk head, massive wings, talons, and often a crowned human form. He is the king of birds and possesses superhuman strength, flight, immortality, and sun-like radiance. Garuda's most defining characteristic is his eternal rivalry with the nagas (serpents), against whom he serves as protector. In Hindu mythology, Garuda obtained the nectar of immortality (amrita) to free his mother from slavery. He is revered as a protector against serpents and poison. Garuda serves as a national symbol in Indonesia and Thailand, appears on national emblems and airline logos (Garuda Indonesia), and remains prominent in temple architecture and popular culture throughout South and Southeast Asia."
