## Overview

Garuda is a divine bird creature central to Hindu and Buddhist mythology. As the mount (vahana) of the god Vishnu, Garuda is depicted with a golden eagle or hawk head, massive wings, talons, and often a crowned human form. He is the king of birds and possesses superhuman strength, flight, immortality, and sun-like radiance.

Garuda's most defining characteristic is his eternal rivalry with the nagas (serpents), against whom he serves as protector. In Hindu mythology, Garuda obtained the nectar of immortality (amrita) to free his mother from slavery.

He is revered as a protector against serpents and poison. Garuda serves as a national symbol in Indonesia and Thailand, appears on national emblems and airline logos (Garuda Indonesia), and remains prominent in temple architecture and popular culture throughout South and Southeast Asia.

## Mythology

### Birth Story
Garuda was born from an egg laid by his mother Vinata after a prolonged gestation. His father was the sage Kashyapa. Upon hatching, his radiance was so great he was mistaken for Agni, the fire god.

### The Quest for Amrita
To free his mother from slavery to the nagas, Garuda had to obtain the amrita (nectar of immortality) from the gods. He successfully stole it through great strength and cunning, defeating the gods' guardians. Vishnu was impressed and offered him a boon, leading Garuda to become his mount. Indra later recovered the amrita.

### Eternal Enmity with Nagas
The eternal conflict between Garuda and the nagas stems from a wager between his mother Vinata and her sister Kadru (mother of nagas), which resulted in Vinata's enslavement. This cosmic rivalry represents the conflict between sky and earth, light and darkness.
